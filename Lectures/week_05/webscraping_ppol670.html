## So you wanna scrape the web...

---

### What does it mean to "scrape" something off the web?

--

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

- leveraging the structure of a website to **grab it's contents**

- using a programming environment (such as R, Python, Java, etc.) to **systematically extract** that content.

- accomplishing the above in an "unobtrusive" and **legal** way.

---

### Website 

As internet consumers, we interact with the interface (or a **rendered version**) of a [webpage](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36156865). Since websites are just rendered code, every piece of that code can be tapped into.

.pull-left[
&lt;img src = "Figures/rendered-webpage.png" width=400&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src = "Figures/html-webpage.png" width=400&gt;
]

---

### The many faces of HTML code

Keep in mind that there is 5 types of coding playing out simultaneously when rendering a website:

--

- **HTML**: generates/creates the actual content of a website
- **XML**: used to transmit data to a webpage from a server
- **PHP**: relays information between a server and the page (think passwords)
- **CSS**: responsible for the design of the website
- **JavaScript**: handles changes and animation.

--

All these different pieces of code work in conjunction (so all will be simultaneously present when viewing a website).

When scraping, we care primarily about **CSS** and **XML**.



---

### The Sturcture of HTML

HTML code is structured using tags, and information is organized hierarchcially (like a list or an array) from top to bottom. When scraping, the tags that are of most use are:

- **p** – paragraphs
- **a href** – links
- **div** – divisions
- **h** – headings
- **table** – tables

We can examine the HTML of a website by inspecting the content within it.

---

### R Packages

There are many packages that can be effectively used to download content from a website. Here I highlight a few, but new stuff is coming out all the time.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


```r
require(rvest) # existing in the tidyverse 
require(httr) # great for interacting with APIs
require(xml2) # rvest draw from this package
require(RCurl) # older but stable. Behaves well with other packages
require(XML) # older but stable. Behaves well with other packages
require(jsonlite) # for dealing with json output
```

## Scraping Content

---

### ABCs of Webscraping 

Let's scrape content off of the following BBC [news story](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36156865).

--

&lt;br&gt;

When scraping data online, keep the following procedure in mind:

- (**A**) identify what information you want
- (**B**) examine the HTML structure and elements
- (**C**) download website
- (**D**) extract element (i.e. it's position)
- (**E**) clean element
- (**F**) store outcome

---

### ABCs of Webscraping 

Let's scrape content off of the following BBC [news story](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36156865).

&lt;br&gt;

Here let's aim to extract three pieces of information from the BBC story:

- **Headline**

- **Date**

- **Story Content**

---

### Download the website


```r
require(rvest) 

url = "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36156865"
site = read_html(url)
site
```

```
## {xml_document}
## &lt;html lang="en" id="responsive-news"&gt;
## [1] &lt;head prefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#"&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Typ ...
## [2] &lt;body id="asset-type-sty" class="device--feature"&gt;\n&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt; ...
```

Here the entire information located on the website is no retained in a single object. **Why is this useful?**

---

### Extract and clean the desired element

Let's locate the XML code for the headline.


```r
headline.path = "//*[@id='page']/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/h1"
headline = site %&gt;% html_node(.,xpath = headline.path)
headline
```

```
## {xml_node}
## &lt;h1 class="story-body__h1"&gt;
```

Still jargon ...


---

### Extract and clean the desired element

We need to clarify what _kind_ of element we are seeking to retrieve (think of this as translating the HTML).


```r
headline = headline %&gt;% html_text(.)
headline
```

```
## [1] "Syria conflict: UN envoy calls on US and Russia to save talks"
```

**Success!**

---

### Extraction takes many forms


```r
site %&gt;% 
  html_node(.,xpath = headline.path) %&gt;% 
  html_name(.)
```

```
## [1] "h1"
```


```r
site %&gt;% 
  html_node(.,xpath = headline.path) %&gt;% 
  html_attrs(.)
```

```
##            class 
## "story-body__h1"
```


```r
site %&gt;% 
  html_node(.,xpath = headline.path) %&gt;% 
  html_structure(.)
```

```
## &lt;h1.story-body__h1&gt;
##   {text}
```

---

### Rinse, wash, and repeat: Date


```r
# Grab the date using CSS
date.path = "#page &gt; div:nth-child(1) &gt; div.container &gt; div &gt; div.column--primary &gt; div.story-body &gt; div.with-extracted-share-icons &gt; div &gt; div.story-body__mini-info-list-and-share-row &gt; div.mini-info-list-wrap &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; div"

# So long! That's why I prefer XML
date = site %&gt;% 
  html_node(.,css = date.path) %&gt;% 
  html_text(.)

# format date into a usable "R format"
date = as.Date(date,"%d %b %Y")
date
```

```
## [1] "2016-04-28"
```

---

### Rinse, wash, and repeat: Story

To get **all** of the body text, we really need to think about what it is we are grabbing. Here comprehending the structure of the website can be really useful.


```r
body.path = "//*[@id='page']/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/p[1]"

site %&gt;% 
  html_node(.,xpath=body.path) %&gt;% 
  html_text(.)
```

```
## [1] "The UN envoy to Syria has urged the US and Russia to intervene \"at the highest level\" to save struggling peace talks."
```

This will only give us a piece of the story – **p[1]**

---

### Rinse, wash, and repeat: Story

But we want the _whole_ thing


```r
body.path = "//*[@id='page']/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/p"

body &lt;- 
  site %&gt;% 
* html_nodes(.,xpath=body.path) %&gt;%
  html_text(.) 
body
```

```

## Building a Scraper

---

### Got the bones? Get the goods

Once you have a blueprint of the HTML structure, you can easily find your way around.

We can **systematically use the information** we know about the HTML structure to grab new information with ease.

This allows us to draw similar information from similarly composed html pages. 
--

### HTML structure changes over time!

Websites are constantly being updated, reformatted, and changed in other ways. This presents a real challenge when scraping, because we need to understand the variability in the structure and adapt our code to it.

---

### Building a "BBC Scraper"

The aim: 

- wrap the three steps from the example into a convenient function. 

- the function takes in a _url_ as **input**, and

- **outputs** the desired web content. 

---


```r
bbc_scraper &lt;- function(url){
     
  # Download website   
  raw = read_html(url)
  
  # Extract headline
  headline = raw %&gt;% 
    html_nodes(.,xpath="//*[@id='page']/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/h1") %&gt;% 
    html_text(.)
  
  # Extract data
  date = raw %&gt;% 
    html_nodes(.,xpath="//*[@id='page']/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[1]/div[1]/ul/li/div") %&gt;% 
    html_text(.) %&gt;% as.Date(.,"%d %b %Y")
  
  # Extract Story
  story = raw %&gt;% 
    html_nodes(.,xpath="//*[@id='page']/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/p") %&gt;% 
    html_text(.) %&gt;% paste0(.,collapse = " ")
  
  # Output as data frame and return
  data.out = data.frame(headline,date,story)
  return(data.out)
}
```


---

Now all we need is to feed it urls


```r
urls &lt;- c("http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36156865",
          "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36162701",
          "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-36166803",
          "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36166632")

output &lt;- c()
for(i in 1:length(urls)){
  draw &lt;- bbc_scraper(urls[i])  
  output &lt;- bind_rows(output,draw)
}

str(output)
```

```

He said that over the past 48 hours an average of one Syrian had been killed every 25 minutes and one wounded every 13 minutes. For the peace talks to succeed, Mr de Mistura said, hostilities would need to be reduced to the levels seen immediately following the February agreement.

He added: \"There are still major differences on the major issues, but there is movement on certain areas where there was not before.\"  Mr de Mistura also said that equal rights and equal representation in major institutions for women was essential to the transition to a new Syria. The peace talks do not involve the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front and the so-called Islamic State, which have been fighting government forces and other rebels across Syria. More than 270,000 people have been killed since Syria's bitter civil war conflict erupted in 2011 and millions have been forced to flee."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
## [2] "The UN says the situation in Syria's city of Aleppo is catastrophic, after dozens of people were killed in attacks on targets including a hospital  Air strikes on and around the Medecins Sans Frontieres-backed al-Quds hospital killed at least 27 people, while more than 30 died in other attacks. UN envoy Jan Egeland said the next days would be vital for the humanitarian aid lifeline for much of Syria. The violence has left a partial truce hanging by a thread. UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura warned the cessation of hostilities agreed between non-jihadist rebels and government forces on 27 February was now \"barely alive\". Separately, the Syrian government reported that 150 US troops had arrived in the town of Rmeilan in Syria's predominantly northern Kurdish province of Hassakeh, denouncing it as an \"illegitimate intervention\". US President Barack Obama said last week he was deploying 250 troops to Syria to help certain rebel groups fight so-called Islamic State (IS). Mr Egeland, the head of the UN humanitarian assistance to Syria, said he had been briefed on \"the catastrophic deterioration in Aleppo over the last 24-48 hours... No-one doubts the severity of the situation.\" He warned that the humanitarian lifeline for much of the country was at risk. \"I could not in any way express how high the stakes are for the next hours and days. \"So many humanitarian health workers and relief workers are being bombed, killed, maimed at the moment that the whole lifeline to millions of people is now also at stake.\" Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said at least 14 patients and three doctors had been killed in the air strike on al-Quds hospital. Among those killed was Mohammed Wasim Moaz, one of the city's last paediatricians, MSF said. An MSF representative, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, told the BBC Dr Moaz had worked at the hospital since 2013. Mr Zabalgogeazkoa said: \"He kept it going, was always there and always worried about the needs of the people. He was honest and very committed. He worked in conditions you cannot even begin to imagine.\" Local sources blamed war planes from the Syrian military or from Russia, which is supporting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, for the attack. The Syrian military denied targeting the hospital. A military source was quoted on state TV as saying: \"Such news is merely an attempt to cover up terrorist crimes which target peaceful citizens in Aleppo.\" An activist at the scene, named Zuhair, told the BBC: \"It was an air strike by two rockets, heavy rockets from [a] Russian air strike. \"Near the hospital, one building on five floors just crumbled and just crashed down and we don't know how many dead will be under these ruins.\" However, Russian news agencies quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying it had carried out no air strikes in Aleppo in the past few days. US Secretary of State John Kerry said he was \"outraged\" by the hospital attack, adding: \"It appears to have been a deliberate strike on a known medical facility and follows the Assad regime's appalling record of striking such facilities.\" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on both the US and Russia to exert pressure to stop the violence, and demanded a credible investigation into the hospital attack. Monitoring groups said at least 20 people were killed in other attacks on rebel-held areas in Aleppo on Thursday, while at least 14 died in rocket strikes on government-controlled neighbourhoods. The upsurge in violence comes amid reports that the Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, is gearing up for a major offensive in Aleppo. One of the reasons why the \"cessation of hostilities\" is now at death's door was reflected in the fact that from the outset it was not called a ceasefire or even a truce, because several factions were excluded, including not just the Islamic State militants but also the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.  Nusra fighters are present in almost all combat zones, and are mixed up with other groups such as Ahrar al-Sham that Russia is now pressing to have added to the international terror list.  That has meant that hostilities have continued and intensified in many areas, with the government able to claim its attacks are legitimate.  Now state forces are reported to be building up in Aleppo as violence escalates there, raising fears that a long and costly all-out battle for the contested city may be looming.  That would put paid both to the lull and to the Geneva peace talks, prompting Mr de Mistura to urge the US, Russians and others to press their clients on the ground to ease off, so that stalled negotiations have a chance of resuming.

## [3] "A 23-year-old Iranian asylum seeker who set himself on fire at Australia's detention centre on the island of Nauru has died.  Australia's immigration department confirmed the man died at Brisbane Hospital on Friday. His actions were a \"political protest\", according to the Nauruan government. Australia sends asylum seekers it intercepts for processing at offshore locations, including Nauru, a small Pacific Island nation.  The man, known as Omid, set himself on fire at the Nauru detention centre on Tuesday and was airlifted to Brisbane Hospital in Australia with severe burns to his torso. A statement from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said it was providing \"appropriate support\" to the man's wife and friends.  Graphic video footage of the incident, which reportedly occurred during a United Nations visit to the island, has been published on Australian news websites. This man's death comes as Australia's other offshore processing centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, is threatened with closure. Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled the detention of asylum seekers was unconstitutional and therefore illegal on Tuesday. The fate of around 850 asylum seekers and refugees on Manus Island - all men - remains uncertain, with Australian and Papua New Guinean officials set to hold talks early next week.  After the Supreme Court's decision, Papuan New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill told Australia it must close the Manus Island centre and make new arrangements. But Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that none of the men on Manus Island will come to Australia.  Mr Turnbull also ruled out sending them to New Zealand, which has previously offered to take some of the refugees Australia refuses to settle, as this would provide a \"marketing opportunity\" for people smugglers.  \"We have to be very, very clear eyed about this. We can't afford to let the empathy that we feel for the desperate circumstances that many people find themselves in to cloud our judgment,\" Mr Turnbull said.  \"Our national security has to come first.\" Meanwhile five MPs from the opposition Labor party have broken ranks and declared they do not support Australia's offshore processing regime.  The tough immigration policy has bipartisan support from Labor and the ruling coalition.  Labor MP Melissa Parke, a former lawyer with the United Nations, said the policy was \"a sick game that needs to end\". \"It's inevitable that the government will need to have another plan for what is going to happen, and the most logical thing to do is to bring those people to Australia,\" Ms Parke told Fairfax Media."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
## [4] "Brazilian prosecutors have filed corruption charges against President Dilma Rousseff's electoral strategist.  Joao Santana was widely seen as the architect of Ms Rousseff's 2010 and 2014 election victories.   He has denied receiving bribes in a scheme to divert funds from the state-run oil company Petrobras.   About 50 Brazilian politicians, including the leader of the lower house of Congress, are under investigation in the Petrobras corruption scandal.  Mr Santana is accused of receiving bribes from several large engineering conglomerates.  Analysts say the charge against him is a further blow for President Rousseff who is facing impeachment proceedings.  He was arrested in February after he returned from the Dominican Republic, where he was working on the re-election campaign of President Danilo Medina. Because of his proximity to her, the arrest is expected to damaged her standing further, even though impeachment proceedings against her are not related to the Petrobras corruption investigation.  A former journalist, Mr Santana is well known for producing dramatic, big-budget campaign videos appealing to poorer voters.  Mr Santana had called the accusations \"unfounded\".  And he had harsh words for the investigation, saying that Brazil was currently living in a \"climate of persecution\". If the investigating judge accepts the allegations against him, Mr Santana will be jailed.  In Brasilia, a special Senate commission has begun hearings ahead of a vote on whether the whole Senate should take on impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff.  A plenary Senate vote is widely expected to take place around 11 May. Across the country,  pro-government supporters blocked major roads in cities in nine Brazilian states during Thursday's morning rush-hour to call for the halt of impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff.   In Sao Paulo, the city saw hundreds of kilometres of traffic jams which formed behind roadblocks of burning tyres. "

# Legality

Now that you've learned how to build a simple scaper. Here are a few things to keep in mind…

**Don't scrape too fast!&lt;/font&gt;**

- Your behavior is statistically distinguishable from human users.

- Constitutes a [DDOS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

- Known the websites **terms of service** – breaking those terms can lead to being banned from the site or even [jail time](https://www.wired.com/2011/07/swartz-arrest/).


---

# Solution

&lt;br&gt;

- **Slow down**

- **Add noise** to make your behavior less statistically distinguishable.

- **Know what you're doing** and who you're doing it to.
  + In the words of Nietzsche: “if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee”
  + That is, the internet is a two way street. Scraping content from some sites puts you on peoples' radar.

- [`robot.txt`](http://www.robotstxt.org/) to know what you can and can't scrape.
  + `www.bbc.com/robots.txt`

---

# Solution

&lt;br&gt;

Create noise by **randomly** putting your scraper to **sleep**.


```r
# One random unit of time drawn from a uniform distribution
runif(1,1,4) 
```

```
## [1] 3.75541
```
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

```r
# Put the system to sleep by that random unit
Sys.sleep(runif(1,1,5))
```

---

# Solution

&lt;br&gt;

Using our previous example, we deliberately slow `bbc_scraper()` down:



```r
output &lt;- c()
for(i in 1:length(urls)){
* Sys.sleep(runif(1,1,5))
  draw &lt;- bbc_scraper(urls[i])  
  output &lt;- bind_rows(output,draw)
}
```

&lt;br&gt;

Keep in mind that if you're a social scientist (which we are), nothing you're doing is **_that_** pressing. You can wait and everyone will be better off for it!

# APIs

---

### Application Programming Interface (API)

- APIs take user requests to a system and return a response (usually in the form of data)
  + Classic example: think waiter at a restraunt, you give him/her your order, waiter goes to the kitchen, waiter brings back what you ordered.
  
- an API is the way applications speak to databases. 
  + For example, when a news interface presents statistics regarding how often someone "liked" a story on social media, they are using an API to request from the social media's database how many time the story has been shared, the social media site's API then returns a number (likes/shares/retweets/etc.) which the news website then reports

- We use APIs all the time: online forms, aggregation sites, apps, ect. 

---

### Application Programming Interface (API)

- There are many kinds of APIs, but we'll focus on **REST APIs** 
  
  + REST == "**re**presntational **s**tate **t**ransfer"
  
  + Works like a website: client makes a request to a server via the http protocol. 
  
  + Looks and behaves much like a url
  
  + Returns data formated as Java Script Object Notation (JSON) data: structured as key value pairs. 
  
  + `httr` packages converts json to lists in `R`
  
- Most all APIs require and **API key** or token to access.

Need to reorganize into a single data frame.We can build this data up by using a loop!

```r
total_entries &lt;- length(fbi_dat$results) 
total_entries
```

```
## [1] 23
```


```r
homicide_data &lt;- c()
for(i in 1:total_entries){
* tmp &lt;- as_tibble(fbi_dat$results[[i]])
  homicide_data &lt;- bind_rows(homicide_data,tmp)
}
homicide_data
```

```
## # A tibble: 23 x 13
##    offense_name data_year unknown range_0_9 range_10_19 range_20_29
##    &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
##  1 Murder and …      2008      97       181         352         963
##  2 Murder and …      2011      47       191         334        1097
##  3 Murder and …      2003      65       112         211         655
##  4 Murder and …      2006     111       159         388        1007
##  5 Murder and …      2009      79       168         371         995

## #   range_70_79 &lt;int&gt;, range_80_89 &lt;int&gt;, range_90_99 &lt;int&gt;
```

Now manipulate...


```r
homicide_data_clean &lt;-
  homicide_data %&gt;%  
  select(-offense_name) %&gt;%   # Drop category (only homicides)
  rename(year = data_year) %&gt;%  # Rename year var
  gather(age_range,count,-year) %&gt;%  # Go from wide to long data
  mutate(age_range = str_remove(age_range,'range_')) %&gt;%  # remove from age categories
  arrange(year,age_range) # Arrange by year, age

# Print
homicide_data_clean
```

```
## # A tibble: 253 x 3
##     year age_range count
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
##  1  1995 0_9          25
##  2  1995 10_19        43
##  3  1995 20_29       112
##  4  1995 30_39       126
##  5  1995 40_49        75
##  6  1995 50_59        29
##  7  1995 60_69        19
##  8  1995 70_79        17
##  9  1995 80_89         3
## 10  1995 90_99         3
## # … with 243 more rows
```

Finally, let's visualize!


```r
homicide_data_clean %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(year,age_range,fill=log(count))) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y="Age Range",x="Year",
       title="Total Number of Deaths by Homicide by Age in the U.S. (1995 to 2018)",
       subtitle="Data drawn from FBI database ")
```
