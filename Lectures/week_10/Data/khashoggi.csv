aljazeera,"Turkey, Istanbul - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul was planned by Saudi officials days in advance. Addressing legislators from his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) on Tuesday, Erdogan detailed Khashoggi's disappearance and murder but stopped short of accusing Saudi royals of the ""savage"" killing that has caused global outrage. ""On September 28, Khashoggi arrived at the Saudi Arabian consulate for him to sort out his wedding paperwork,"" Erdogan said during the speech in the Turkish parliament in the capital, Ankara. ""It seems that at that time they [Saudi Arabian officials] started to plan a roadmap for his murder."" He added that some Saudi officials left Turkey and travelled to Saudi Arabia, ""indicating they planned the murder"". Khashoggi, 59, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate on October 2. Until Tuesday's speech, Erdogan had remained largely silent on the case, although unnamed Turkish officials have leaked information about the murder, including information about a 15-member Saudi ""assassination team"" who flew into Istanbul on two chartered planes. In the wake of intense global pressure, Saudi Arabia admitted last week that Khashoggi was killed inside its Istanbul consulate on October 2 as a result of a ""fistfight"" during an interrogation. Saudi authorities arrested 18 people in connection with the killing and fired top security officials considered close to bin Salman. Erdogan called the killing a ""political murder"", adding that international investigators should be included in the probe. The Turkish leader went on to call the killing ""savage"", adding that Ankara would continue its investigation until all questions have been answered. ""Why did they [the Saudi team] come to Istanbul, on instruction by whom?"" Erdogan asked, adding that Saudi Arabia should make clear why it did not let investigators into the consulate until days later. 'Where is the body?' Galip Dalay, visiting scholar at the University of Oxford, stressed the significance of Erdogan's speech. ""The most important thing is that Erdogan confirmed everything we sort of heard through other channels,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""However, now it's no longer attributed to unnamed Turkish officials, but it's the president of Turkey who has confirmed what has happened,"" Dalay said. Erdogan also demanded answers on what happened to Khashoggi's body, mentioning reports that a local cooperator allegedly disposed of it. ""Where is the body? There are claims his body has been given to a local person, but who is this local person?"" Erdogan asked. ""Nobody is allowed to think this case will come to an end without answering all these questions,"" he added. The Turkish president also said Saudi Arabia was taking the right steps by working with Ankara on the investigation and carrying out the 18 arrests. Dalay, who is also a non-resident fellow at Brookings Institution Doha, underlined Erdogan's ""distinction"" in his speech between King Salman and his son, bin Salman. ""Everything that Erdogan provided pointed towards MBS, without naming the crown prince specifically,"" said Dalay, adding that the Turkish president was clearly trying to prevent a full-blown crisis between Ankara and Riyadh. On Sunday, speaking in an exclusive interview with Fox News, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Khashoggi's killing inside the consulate was ""a terrible tragedy"" and that MBS had nothing to do with it. Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, told Al Jazeera that he thought Erdogan was taking the right steps. ""The Saudis know very well what Turkey knows, and what Erdogan has been doing is the right thing, namely asking the Saudis for full cooperation in this case."""
bbc,"Recep Tayyip Erdogan says many questions need to be answered The killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was planned days in advance, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told MPs from his ruling party. He said Turkey had strong evidence Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. He also called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. He demanded Saudi Arabia provide answers about where Khashoggi's body was, and who had ordered the operation. The Saudi kingdom has provided conflicting accounts of what happened to Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post contributor. After weeks of maintaining he was still alive, the authorities now say the 59-year-old was killed in a rogue operation. Mr Erdogan's address coincided with the start of an investment conference in Saudi Arabia that has been overshadowed by the Khashoggi case. Dozens of government and business leaders have pulled out, but Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared at the event on Tuesday. Many world leaders have condemned the murder of the prominent Saudi critic and demanded a full investigation. US President Donald Trump says he is not satisfied with the Saudi explanation but he has also highlighted the kingdom's importance as a US ally. CIA director Gina Haspel has been sent to Turkey to review the matter. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? What did the Turkish president say happened? Fifteen Saudi nationals, Mr Erdogan said, arrived in Istanbul in three teams, on separate flights, in the days and hours leading up to the murder. A day before the killing, he said, some members from the group travelled to Belgrad forest, near the consulate - an area searched last week by Turkish police looking for the body. He also described how the team had removed the hard drives from the consulate's surveillance camera system prior to the arrival of Khashoggi, who was visiting to obtain documents for his forthcoming marriage. A man who looked like Khashoggi, wearing his outfit, glasses and a fake beard, was among a group who left the consulate the same day as the killing, the president added. On Monday, CNN broadcast images appearing to show that Saudi operative leaving the consulate.

He told MPs from his ruling AK party the 18 should ""be tried in Istanbul"", adding that ""all those who played a role in the murder"" would be punished. What did he say about the Saudis? Mr Erdogan called for an independent commission to be set up but said he was confident in King Salman's full co-operation. He did not mention the crown prince, widely seen as the most powerful figure in the kingdom. Many believe he ordered the killing, although the Saudis deny this. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says Mr Erdogan's speech was notable as much for what it left out as for what it left in. There was no mention of the much-discussed audio tape from inside the Saudi consulate which Turkish media say reveals gruesome details of the murder. Trailed as something that would expose ""the naked truth"", the speech fell well short of many people's expectations, our correspondent says. Where do the Saudis stand? King Salman chaired a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, after which a statement said that Saudi Arabia would hold to account those responsible for the killing, whoever they might be. Image copyright EPA Image caption The Saudi king (R) and crown prince (2R) meet Khashoggi's son, Salah bin Jamal (L), and another family member in Riyadh State media also said the king and the crown prince had held a meeting in Riyadh with members of the Khashoggi family, including Khashoggi's son, Salah bin Jamal. Mr Erdogan also spoke to family members by phone on Tuesday, offering condolences and saying he would do all he could to solve the murder. Saudi Arabia has given conflicting accounts up to now, initially saying Khashoggi had left the building alive, then later saying that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. On Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister acknowledged Khashoggi had been murdered but said the leadership had not been aware of the ""rogue operation"". ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,"" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News. ""There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up."" He said that Saudi Arabia did not know where the body was. An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing President Erdogan demanded in his speech on Tuesday for this individual's identity to be revealed. In addition to the arrests, the Saudis say they have sacked two of the crown prince's aides and set up an organisation, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency over the killing. According to Reuters news agency, quoting Turkish and Arabic intelligence sources, one of the sacked aides appeared via Skype during Khashoggi's questioning. Saud al-Qahtani was quoted as giving the instructions ""bring me the head of the dog"", after the two men traded insults. The sources say President Erdogan has a copy of the Skype audio but is refusing to hand it over to the US. Who is at the investment conference? BBC's Sebastian Usher in Riyadh Image copyright Sebastian Usher Image caption A media scrum as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives at the conference There's an odd mixture of unreality and hard-faced pragmatism here. Attendees say they're here to stay with the opportunities Saudi Arabia provides for the long haul - however much pressure may be building in the short term. But that means that the urgency and outrage over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi that is fuelling the news outside is absent here. As President Erdogan was delivering his explosive speech, the conference here announced $50bn (£38.5bn) of investment in 12 mega-deals. The contracts were signed with a flourish by a host of foreign CEOs with their Saudi partners to the applause of the audience. It was no doubt intended as a resounding vote of confidence in the vision of Saudi Arabia's future laid out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But that future and those investments could still turn sour, despite the mood of optimism and self-approbation exhibited here."
breitbart,"U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan both pronounced themselves unsatisfied with the answers Saudi Arabia has given for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul three weeks ago. Both said the Saudis must be more forthcoming about who ordered the operation that ended with Khashoggi’s death, followed by crude efforts to create an alibi and dispose of his body. Erdogan was forceful in a speech to his AKP party on Tuesday, although he came up short of accusing Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of direct involvement with the killing. “It is clear that this savage murder did not happen instantly but was planned,” Erdogan declared, dismissing the Saudi story about Khashoggi accidentally dying in a “fistfight” he started when he visited the Istanbul consulate. “Why was a team of 15 Saudi men, all with qualifications related to the incident, gathering in Istanbul on the day of the murder?” the Turkish president asked. “We are seeking answers to this question. On whose orders did those individuals go there?” “Putting all the burden on a few security and intelligence members would satisfy neither us nor the international community. We could be satisfied only if everyone, from the one giving the order to the one who carried it out, are called to account,” he insisted. Erodgan called on King Salman to support a Turkish investigation of the killing and trials in Turkish court, arguing the Istanbul consulate “may be considered Saudi Arabian land, but it rests within the borders of Turkey.” He also demanded the Saudis reveal the name of the “local cooperator” who allegedly disposed of Khashoggi’s remains. Erdogan very conspicuously praised “the sincerity of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz,” but avoided either praising or condemning the day-to-day ruler of the country, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He also implied there might be a “partner in crime” in “other countries.” “I am not satisfied with what I’ve heard,” President Trump said on Monday from the White House. “I don’t want to lose all that investment that’s been made in our country. But we’re going to get to the bottom of it,” Trump added. President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has a close friendship with the crown prince, said on Monday he has urged MBS to be “fully transparent.” “The world is watching. This is a very, very serious accusation and a very serious situation,” he said. The Washington Post, which employed Khashoggi as a contributor, on Saturday returned to the topic of the much-discussed Turkish surveillance tape of Khashoggi’s murder, which became the subject of a media scandal last week when the U.S. State Department and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo strongly refuted Turkish media claims that Pompeo has listened to the audio. According to the Post, the audio exists and anonymous CIA officials have heard it, but they have not yet confirmed its authenticity. The Post strongly implied the audio has been deliberately withheld from Pompeo and other top officials so they will not be placed in an uncomfortable diplomatic situation with the Saudis."
cnn,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Jamal Khashoggi died as a result of a brutal premeditated murder, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday, in a highly anticipated speech in which he soundly rejected Saudi Arabia's claim that the journalist was killed accidentally.Erdogan questioned whether Riyadh was able to carry out an independent investigation in to the death of the Washington Post journalist, and he demanded that the 18 suspects arrested by authorities in Saudi Arabia be extradited to Turkey to stand trial in Istanbul.It was the first time that any official in Turkey has publicly outlined the Turkish contention that Khashoggi was killed at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul by a hit squad sent from Riyadh. While Erdogan did not offer any bombshell revelations, his speech amounted to a comprehensive rejection of Saudi Arabia's case that Khashoggi died by accident as a result of a brawl.People gather around a TV at an Istanbul cafe to watch Erdogan's speech.""The information obtained so far and the evidence found shows that Khashoggi was murdered in a ferocious manner,"" Erdogan told lawmakers in the Turkish capital, Ankara.Among the new details revealed by Erdogan was an allegation that, on the day before Khashoggi was killed, a team of consular staff carried out a reconnaissance mission in a forest on the outskirts of Istanbul, and at Yalova, a city about a 55-mile (90-kilometer) drive south. Erdogan did not say why the locations were scouted, but he noted later that Khashoggi's body has yet to be found.Read More"
fox,"Saudi officials planned the savage murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi days before his death, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. Erdogan revealed the details of the country’s investigation into Khashoggi’s killing after he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, contradicting Saudi Arabia’s explanation that the writer was killed in a “fistfight.” Erdogan fell short of blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and made no mention of whether a tape exists of Khashoggi's killing. However, he kept the pressure on the kingdom with his demands for punishment of all the people involved in the murder. “All evidence gathered shows that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a savage murder. To cover up such a savagery would hurt the human conscience,” he said. Erdogan said he wanted Saudi Arabia to allow the 18 suspects detained in the columnist’s killing to be tried in Turkish courts. “To blame such an incident on a handful of security and intelligence members would not satisfy us or the international community,” Erdogan said. “Saudi Arabia has taken an important step by admitting the murder. As of now we expect of them to openly bring to light those responsible — from the highest ranked to the lowest — and to bring them to justice” Erdogan laid out a timeline of the events before and after Khashoggi’s death, including the use of a “body double” as a decoy. Three people flew from Riyadh to Istanbul at around 4:30 p.m. local time on Oct. 1 and went to the hotel and later to the Saudi consulate, Erdogan said, according to Sky News. Another team went from the consulate to Belgrave woods and Yelova, near the consulate, to scout the area, he said. The next day, Erdogan said, a team of about 15 Saudis met at the consulate between 9:50 a.m. and 11 a.m. He said the team took out the “hard disc” from the consulate’s CCTV and called Khashoggi to let him know he had a meeting at the consulate later in the day. ""All evidence gathered shows that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a savage murder"" — Turkish President Erdogan Khashoggi arrived at the consulate at around 1:08 p.m. local time and was never seen again, Erdogan said. Almost five hours later, Khashoggi’s fiancé alerted authorities that he had been detained or worse. In his speech, Erdogan suggested Khashoggi was the victim of a “gruesome murder” and said there could be no cover-up. “I do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman. That being said, independent investigation needs to be carried out. This is a political killing,” Erdogan said, adding Khashoggi’s death was meticulously planned. Erdogan also noted he spoke with President Trump about the killing, but didn’t reveal details about their conversation. Trump said Monday he wasn’t satisfied with the explanations he’s heard about the killing of Khashoggi and was waiting for reports from U.S. officials returning from the region. “We're going to get to the bottom of it. We have people over in Saudi Arabia now. We have top intelligence people in Turkey. They're coming back either tonight or tomorrow,” Trump told the media before leaving a rally in Texas.
