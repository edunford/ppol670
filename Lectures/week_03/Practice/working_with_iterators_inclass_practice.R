#' Practice: Working with Iterators
#'


#'
#' Question 1:
#'
#' Write a loop that iterates over the following two vectors, and multiplies the
#' values located at each index location.
#'

vec1 = c(3,5,7,3,99,-10)
vec2 = c(3.3,4.2,77.5,6,102,10034)





#'
#' Question 2:
#'
#' Write a loop that iterate through the `mtcars` data frame and print the
#' message "Low Gear" if the gear variable is less than 4, else print "High
#' Gear"
#'

dat <- mtcars




#'
#' Question 3
#'
#' Write a while loop that multiplies the current and prior values in the vector
#' `values`. Make sure the while loop stops iterating after the length of the
#' added number exceeds 6 digits (hint: `nchar(100)`)
#'

values = 1:10e7
