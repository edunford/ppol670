# Statistical Learning

---

### What is statistical learning?

The aim is to model the  relationship between the outcome and some set of features features

`$$y = f(X) + \epsilon$$`

where 

- `\(y\)` is the outcome/dependent/response variable 

- `\(X\)` is a matrix of predictor/feature/independent variables 

- `\(f\)` is some fixed but unknown function mapping `\(X\)` to `\(y\)`. The "signal" in the data.

- `\(\epsilon\)` is some random error term. The "noise" in the data.

---

### What is statistical learning?

Statistical learning refers to a set of methods/approaches for estimating `\(f\)`. 

`$$\hat{y} = \hat{f}(X)$$`

Where `\(\hat{f}(X)\)` is an approximation of the "true" functional form ( `\(f(X)\)` ), and `\(\hat{y}\)` is the predicted value.

The aim is to find a `\(\hat{f}(X)\)` that minimizes the **_reducible_ error**.

--

`$$E(y - \hat{y})^2$$`
`$$E[f(X) + \epsilon -  \hat{f}(X)]^2$$`

`$$\underbrace{E[f(X) -\hat{f}(X)]^2}_{\text{Reducible}} + \underbrace{var(\epsilon)}_{\text{Irreducible}}$$`

---

### Reducible vs. Irreducible Error

`$$\underbrace{E[f(X) -\hat{f}(X)]^2}_{\text{Reducible}} + \underbrace{var(\epsilon)}_{\text{Irreducible}}$$`



The **"reducible" error** is the systematic **signal**. We can reduce this error by using different functional forms, better data, or a mixture of those two. 

The **"irreducible" error** is associated with the random **noise** around `\(y\)`. 

Statistical learning is concerned with minimizing the reducible error. However, our predictions  will never be perfect given the irreducible error. There is a lower bound on how accurate we can be.

---

### Inference vs. Prediction

Two reasons we want to estimate `\(f(\cdot)\)`: 

--

- **Inference**

  + Goal is **_interpretation_**
  
      - _Which predictors are associated with the response?_
      - _What is the relationship between the response and the predictors?_
      - _Is the relationship causal?_
      
  + **&lt;font color = "darkred"&gt; Key limitation&lt;/font&gt;**: 
  
    - using functional forms that are easy to interpret (like lines) might be far away from the true form of `\(f(X)\)`.
  
---
  
### Inference vs. Prediction

Two reasons we want to estimate `\(f(\cdot)\)`: 
  
- **Prediction**

  + Goal is to **_predict_** future values of the outcome
  
  + `\(\hat{f}(X)\)` is treated as a **&lt;font color=#282828&gt;_black box_&lt;/font&gt;**: model doesn't need to be interpretable as long as it provides an accurate prediction of `\(y\)`.
  
  + **&lt;font color = "darkred"&gt; Key limitation&lt;/font&gt;**: 
  
      - Interpretation: it is difficult to know which variables are doing the heavy lifting and the exact influence of `\(x\)` on `\(y\)`.
      

---

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

- &lt;u&gt;**Supervised Learning**&lt;/u&gt; (our focus today)

  - for each observation of the predictor measurement `\(x_i\)` there is an associated response measurement `\(y_i\)`. In essence, there is an _outcome_ we are aiming to accurately predict or understand.
  
  - use regression and classification methods
  
&lt;img src="week-07-lecture-supervised-learning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
  
 
---
  
### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
  
- &lt;u&gt;**Unsupervised Learning**&lt;/u&gt;  

  - we observe a vector of measurements `\(x_i\)` but _no_ associated response `\(y_i\)`.
  
  - "unsupervised" because we lack a response variable that can supervise our analysis.

# Supervised Learning

---

### Regression vs. Classification

_Outcomes_ come in many forms. How the outcome is distributed will determine the methods we use. 

--

- **Quantitative** outcome

  + a continuous/interval-based outcome: e.g. housing price, number of bills passed, stock market prices, etc.
  
  + Regression Methods: linear, penalization, generalized additive models (GAMs) 
  
  + Both parametric and non-parametric ways of approximating `\(f(\cdot)\)`


---

### Regression vs. Classification

_Outcomes_ come in many forms. How the outcome is distributed will determine the methods we use. 

- **Quantitative** outcome

- **Qualitative** outcome

  + a discrete categorical outcome
  
      + _Binary_: War/No War; Sick/Not Sick
      
      + _Ordered_: Don't Support, Neutral, Support
      
      + _Categorical_: Cat, Dog, Bus, ... 
      
  + Classification Methods: logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines
  
---

### Regression vs. Classification

_Outcomes_ come in many forms. How the outcome is distributed will determine the methods we use. 

- **Quantitative** outcome

- **Qualitative** outcome
 
- Some methods can be used on either outcome type
  - K nearest neighbors
  - tree-based methods (random forest, gradient boosting)

- Every model has specific **tuning parameters** that we can use to optimize performance. 
  
---

### Interpretation vs. Flexibility

&lt;br&gt;
.center[_"There is no free lunch in statistics"_]

.pull-left[
- No one method dominates all others over all possible data sets. 

- it is an important task to decide for any given set of data which method produces the best results

- Balance between  model interpretation and model flexibility

### Under-fitting (Bias)

&lt;img src="week-07-lecture-supervised-learning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Over-fitting (Variance)

&lt;img src="week-07-lecture-supervised-learning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Model Accuracy

- We need to quantify the extent to which the predicted response value for a given observation is close to the true response value for that observation

--

- There are many metrics for model accuracy. Which metric you use depends on:

  + type of learning problem you are trying to solve 
  
  + what you aspect of the model you're aiming to optimize
  
--
  
- In the regression setting, the most common accuracy metric _mean squared error_ (MSE).

`$$MSE = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - \hat{f}(X_i))^2}{N}$$`


---

### Model Accuracy

&lt;img src="week-07-lecture-supervised-learning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

### Training and Test Data

- Utilize accuracy metrics to assess model performance, &lt;u&gt;_but we can always make our models flexible enough to minimize the MSE_&lt;/u&gt;. 

--

- Need to see how accurate the model is on **_previously unseen data_**.

- Data is usually hard to come by so we partition the data into **training** and **test** sets. The idea is to hold the test data back (never look at it).

--

- Use the test data to calculate the **out of sample predictive accuracy**. 

- By holding off some data we can reduce the tendency to **over-fit** the data.

---

### Model accuracy on New Data 



&lt;img src="week-07-lecture-supervised-learning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

.center[&lt;img src = "Figures/bias-variance-tradeoff.png",width=800&gt;]

- **high variance**: new data, new pattern.

- **high bias**: rigid pattern, doesn't reflect the data 


---

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

.center[&lt;img src = "Figures/bias-variance-tradeoff.png"&gt;]

- Reality is a **tradeoff**

  - More variance, less bias
  
  - More bias, less variance

# Cross-Validation

---

### What is cross-validation?

&lt;br&gt;

- As we saw, the training error will always be less than the test error due to over-fitting. We need to see how our model performs on data it wasn't trained on (test error)

- "**Re-sampling**" involves repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about the fitted model. 

- We can use re-sampling techniques to **generate estimates for the test error**. 

- Let's look at **three** cross-validation approaches.


---

### Validation Set Approach

- Involves randomly dividing the data into two comparably sized samples, a training set and a validation/test/hold-out set.

- Model is fit to the training set then used to predict the response in the validation set. 

- The resulting error provides an estimate of the test error rate. 
&lt;br&gt;
.center[
&lt;img src="Figures/validation-set.png"&gt;
]

---

### Validation Set Approach

**&lt;font color = "darkred"&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/font&gt;**

- Highly variable: test error rate is sensitive to the estimates that are in the training and test set. 

- Overestimates the test error: only trained on one sub-sample of the data. Models tend to perform worse when trained on less data. 
&lt;br&gt;
.center[
&lt;img src="Figures/validation-set.png"&gt;
]

---

### "Leave-One-Out" Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

- Involves splitting the set of observations into two parts. Rather than creating two subsets of comparable size, a single observation is used for the validation set. 

- Estimate the model on `\(N-1\)` observation, then test on the remaining observation.

- Do this `\(N\)` times and average the test error. 

.center[
&lt;img src="Figures/LOOCV.png"&gt;
]


---

### "Leave-One-Out" Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

Far less biased than the validation approach. Does not overestimate the test error. No randomness in the training/test split

**&lt;font color = "darkred"&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/font&gt;**: 

- Computationally expensive: you have to re-estimate the same model N times!

.center[
&lt;img src="Figures/LOOCV.png"&gt;
]

---


### `\(K\)`-Fold Cross-Validation

- Involves randomly dividing the data into `\(k\)` groups (or folds). Model is trained on `\(k-1\)` folds, then test on the remaining fold. 

- Process is repeated `\(k\)` times, each time using a new fold. Offers `\(k\)` estimates of the test error, which we average. 

.center[
&lt;img src="Figures/k-fold-validation.png"&gt;
]

---

### `\(K\)`-Fold Cross-Validation

- Less computationally expensive (LOOCV is a special case of `\(K\)`-fold where `\(k = n\)`) 

- Gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate than LOOCV

&lt;img src="Figures/k-fold-validation.png"&gt;

# Performance Metrics 

---

### How did we do? 

- Our aim is to model the signal, not the noise. As we've seen, model over-fitting is a real problem, but re-sampling methods can offer us a way out. 

- Central to any machine learning task is how we choose to define "good" performance. 

--

- When dealing with quantitative outcomes (intervals), we can utilize metrics like MSE to assess performance.

`$$MSE = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - \hat{f}(X_i))^2}{N}$$`

- Central to any machine learning task is how we choose to define "good" performance. 

- When dealing with quantitative outcomes (intervals), we can utilize metrics like MSE to assess performance.

- When dealing with qualitative outcome (categories), we need to rely on different metrics to assess performance.

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correctly Classified}}{\text{Total Possible}}$$`
`$$\text{Error} = 1 - \text{Accuracy}$$`

### The Weather Today 

Consider if we were testing the accuracy of two weather persons. Below are their forecasts for the weather in a given week alongside the observed weather pattern. (For now, let's just focus on binary outcomes: sunny day or rainy day)

.center[
|Weather Person | M | Tu | W | Th | F | St | Su |
|---------------|---|----|---|----|---|----|----|
| `\(WP_1\)` Prediction | Rain | Sun  | Rain | Sun | Sun | Rain | Rain |
| `\(WP_2\)` Prediction | Sun  | Sun  | Sun  | Sun | Sun | Sun  | Sun  |
| Actual            | Sun  | Sun  | Rain | Sun | Sun | Sun  | Sun |
]

--

.center[
|Weather Person | Correct | Total | Accuracy | Error |
|---------------|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| `\(WP_1\)`        |    4    |   7   |   57.1%  | 42.9% |
| `\(WP_2\)`        |    6    |   7   |   85.7%  | 14.3% |
]

If we calculate the accuracy for each, it looks as if Weather Person 2 is the most accurate. Does that make sense?

| `\(WP_2\)`        |    6    |   7   |   85.7%  | 14.3% |
]

Rain is **rare**. We can always have high accuracy if we just guess sun every day. This is generates a problem if what people care about is when to pack an umbrella!

### Confusion Matrix

&lt;br&gt; 

.center[
|                       |  `\(Positive_{~~\text{Actual}}\)` |  `\(Negative_{~~\text{Actual}}\)` |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|
| `\(Positive_{~~\text{Predicted}}\)`  |   True Positive (TP)       | False Positive (FP)          |
| `\(Negative_{~~\text{Predicted}}\)`  |   False Negative (FN)       |  True Negative (TN)         |

]

--

&lt;br&gt;

| Metric | Calculation |  Description |
|---|-----| -----|
| Accuracy | `\(\frac{TP + TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}\)` | In total, how accurate is the model |
| Precision | `\(\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\)` | Of the true positives classified, how many are actually positive | 
| Specificity | `\(\frac{ TN }{ TN + FP }\)` | Of the actual true negatives, how many were correctly classified | 
| Recall/Sensitivity | `\(\frac{TP}{ TP + FN}\)` | Of the actual true positives, how many were correctly classified |


---

### Weather Person 1

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
|                       |  `\(Positive_{~~\text{Actual}}\)` |  `\(Negative_{~~\text{Actual}}\)` |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|
| `\(Positive_{~~\text{Predicted}}\)`  |   3      |  0   |
| `\(Negative_{~~\text{Predicted}}\)`  |   3      |  1   |

]

&lt;br&gt;

- Accuracy = 57.1%

- Precision = 1%

- Specificity = 100%

- Recall = 50%


---

### Weather Person 2

&lt;br&gt;

.center[
|                       |  `\(Positive_{~~\text{Actual}}\)` |  `\(Negative_{~~\text{Actual}}\)` |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|
| `\(Positive_{~~\text{Predicted}}\)`  |   6      |  1   |
| `\(Negative_{~~\text{Predicted}}\)`  |   0      |  0   |

]

&lt;br&gt;

- Accuracy = 85.7%

- Precision = 85.7%

- Specificity = 0%

- Recall = 100%

---

### ROC Curves

Consider the following: 

- We want to predict how many rainy days (1) there will be, sunny otherwise (0). 

- Our model outputs probabilities of a rainy day where 0 means no chance, 1 means it's absolutely going to rain. 
  
&lt;br&gt;  
  



```r
# Our estimated probabilities 
est_probs 
```

```
## [1] 0.4 0.7 0.3 0.5 0.9 0.1 0.7
```



---

### ROC Curves

Consider the following: 

- We need to convert these probabilities to predictions. We can do this by setting a **threshold**.
  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  

```r
threshold = .5
our_preds = as.numeric(est_probs &gt;= threshold)
our_preds
```

```
## [1] 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
```


---

### ROC Curves


Consider the following: 

- We can now compare these predictions to the actual values. 


```r
table(our_preds,true_values)
```

```
##          true_values
## our_preds 0 1
##         0 2 1
##         1 1 3
```

- Thresholds reflect how sensitive we are to true or false positives. 
  
  + The higher the threshold, the less false positives.
  + The lower the threshold, the more false positives but more true positives. 
  + It's another tradeoff!
  
---

### ROC Curves

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve offers a visual representation of model performance across different potential thresholds.  

.center[&lt;img src = "Figures/roc-plot.png", width=400&gt;]


---

### Area Under the Curve (AUC)

We can calculate the area under the ROC curve to quickly and easily compare model performance.

### Machine learning in `R`

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- There are LARGE assortment of ML packages in `R`: essentially one for every possible learning method. 

- Each package has it's own unique ways of reading data in, outputting results, and post-processing. 

- This can make it difficult to implement different types of models quickly.

- The [`caret` package](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) eases this process by creating a system of wrapper functions that make it very easy to implement models


---

### `caret` 

- The main `caret` function is `train()`, 

  + `method = ` argument allows us to select a specific machine learning algorithm. 
  
  + `trControl = ` argument allows us to feed it a `trainControl()` function which allows use to easily set cross-validation specifications. 
  
  + `metric =` argument allows us to specify what sorts of accuracy metrics the best performing model should be evaluated by. 
  
  + `tuneGrid =` argument allows us to easily try out different tuning parameters (more on this later).
