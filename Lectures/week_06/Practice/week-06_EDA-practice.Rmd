# Task 

Explore either the chicago `crime` data or the `credit_data` from the lecture.  Specifically, ask 5 questions of the data and generate at least 5 plots. Transform the data if necessary. Try to see if there is anything interesting that emerges among the features.

Both datasets can be extracted using the following code chunks (see below).


# Data 

```{r,eval=F}
# For the credit data
credit_data <- recipes::credit_data
```

```{r}
# For the Chicago crime data used in lecture
crimes = crimedata::get_crime_data(years=2012:2016,
                                   cities="Chicago",
                                   type = "sample")
```
