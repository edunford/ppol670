### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is an **_iterative cycle_**:

![:space 5]

1. **_Generate_** questions about your data.

2. Search for answers by **_visualizing_**, **_transforming_**, and **_modelling_** your data.

3. Use what you learn to **_refine_** your questions and/or generate new questions.

![:space 5]

EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. Feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some will work and offer valuable insights, others won't.

### Weak priors on the DGP

Often we are need to elicit answers from data where we know little about the **_data generating process_** (DGP)

  - Little to no academic work to guide our expectations.
  
  - New data type that does not conform cleanly to past operationalizations of well-defined theoretical concepts.
  
  - Data is entirely foreign to you 
      
      + Data outside your domain of _expertise_ --- e.g., you study conflict but you need to examine healthcare data.
      
      + Data outside your domain of _expectation_ --- e.g., a company's internal data logs that you need to draw insight on.

###  Data Exploration Steps 

Given new data, how best should one draw novel insights?

--

- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 0)_**: **_Train/Test Split_**
  
  - Always the first step. 
  - Split the data and never look at, learn from, or examine the test data.
  - We can probe, model, and theorize about the training data _as long as we've held off test data_ to validate our conclusions.

###  Data Exploration Steps 

Given new data, how best should one draw novel insights?

- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 0)_**: **_Train/Test Split_**
- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 1)_**: **_Understanding what data you have_**
  
  - <u>_Data Properties_</u>
      - What is the unit of analysis?
      - What are the data types?
          - integers, floats, categorical, ordered scales?
      - What sources of variation are there?
      - How is that data distributed?
      - Are there oddities in the data? 
          - e.g. housing price data with a lot of 0s. 
      - Is the data incomplete? If so, why?
      - Should the data be transformed?
      - Are there ways to back out new variables from the variables you have? ("feature engineering")

- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 0)_**: **_Train/Test Split_**
- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 1)_**: **_Understanding what data you have_**
  
  - <u>_Data Properties_</u>
  - <u>_Data Generation_</u> (questions to ask yourself)
      - How was the data generated?
          - Hand coded vs. machine coded?
          - Self-reported?
          - Convenience sample?
          - Complete? Incomplete? Why?
      - How fit is the data to answer your (or any) inquiry?
      - In what ways could the data be distorted or biased?
      - Are the concepts measured in the data clearly defined? 
          - If so, why do you believe that? 
          - If not, where does the issue lie?

- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 1)_**: **_Understanding what data you have_**
- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 2)_**: **_Analyzing the relationships_**

  - What variables are highly correlated?
  - What is the relationship between the variables?
  - What can bi-variate models tell us about the relationship between two (or more) variables?
  - Does a decomposition reveal anything interesting about the variation in the data?
  - Does the data cluster in interesting ways? 
  - Can we plot the data spatially or temporally? Do any interesting patterns emerge?

- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 2)_**: **_Analyzing the relationships_**
- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 3)_**: **_Unpacking the outcome_**

  - What outcome variable do you care about (or seems important) in the data? 
  - Build a model that best predicts this outcome.
  - Explore the most predictive model
      - What features/variables mattered most in the prediction task?
      - What are the marginal effects of these most predictive features?
      - Is there any heterogeneity in the predicted value of the model across certain observations?

- **_![:text_color darkorange](Step 4)_**: **_Theorize_**

  - What are some hypotheses that we might be able to generate from the data?
  - What confounders might be lurking generating spurious correlations?
	- What are some plausible interventions that we might be able to employ to test a causal relationship?
		- Are those interventions ethical?
		- Are those interventions practical?
