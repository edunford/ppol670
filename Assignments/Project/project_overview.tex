\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

The following provides an overview of the data science project that you
will be responsible for completing by the end of the semester. The
project is an opportunity to apply the skills and tools that you've
learned throughout the course on an area of substantive interest to you.

The project is composed of three distinct parts: a proposal, a
presentation, and a report. The proposal should outline the general plan
for the project and will serve as an opportunity for the professor and
teaching assistant to provide guidance on its feasibility. The
presentation is an opportunity to present your work in mid-stream to
receive verbal feedback from the professor, TA, and classmates. These
comments will hopefully help you as you move forward with the final
report. The report is the written analysis of the project in its
entirety. The report will be due on December 11 @ 9pm (PPOL670's
designated finals slot).

The proposal, presentation materials, and the report should be generated
using
\href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html}{RMarkdown}
and should follow all reproducibility practices discussed in class.

October 28 & 5\% & 2 pages/750-1000 words (single-spaced; 12pt
font)\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The project proposal asks that you sketch out a general 2 page
(single-spaced; 12pt font; 750-1000 words) project proposal. The
proposal should offer the following information:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A high-level statement of the problem you intend to address or the
  analysis you aim to generate;
\item
  The data source(s) you intend to use;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The data you choose to utilize should take some effort to compose
    (it shouldn't be entirely ``off-the-shelf data'', i.e.~data easily
    downloaded online).
  \item
    If using API's or other easily downloadable data sources (such as
    World Bank data) to collect your data, try joining other data to the
    downloaded data, change the unit of analysis, etc.
  \item
    In general, one should have some wrangling component to get their
    data in order.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your plan to obtain that data;
\item
  The methods (learned in class) that you aim to employ; and

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The project must contain:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      a data wrangling component
    \item
      (multiple) data visualizations
    \item
      a machine (statistical) learning component
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A definition for what ``success'' means with respect to your project.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In your words, what would a successful project look like? How will
    you know that you solved the problem or accomplished your goal?
  \item
    Four weeks isn't a long time to complete a project like this.
    Thinking serious about what a ``finished'' or ``successful'' project
    might look like. This will help you set realistic
    goals/expectations.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Please be detailed but \emph{succinct} as possible when writing.
\emph{Any material that exceeds page 2 (1000 words) will not be
considered when grading/reading}. There is no advantage/incentive to
exceeding the page limit. Be sure to properly cite any referenced
materials and/or packages (it is okay if your work cited runs onto a
third page).

\textbf{Due} & \textbf{Proportion of Grade} &

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{part-1-video-presentation}{%
\subsection{Part 1: Video
Presentation}\label{part-1-video-presentation}}

Please prepare and record a 7 minute presentation that walks us through
the progress you've made on your project to date. The presentation is an
opportunity to summarize your project and talk through your
(preliminary) results. Moreover, it'll provide an opportunity for both
your peers and the Professor/TA to provide constructive feedback, which
you can then incorporate into your final paper.

When preparing your recording, please prepare slides \emph{using
\texttt{R\ Markdown}}. \textbf{Students should not ``live code'' or show
output from their computer.} This is meant to be a polished presentation
as if you were giving it in-person.

The slides should generally adhere to the following format. You should
plan on having up to 5-10 slides in total. The layout of the
presentation should take on the following form.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  (1-3 slides) Problem statement and Background
\item
  (1-3 slides) Methods you explored or considered using.
\item
  (1-3 slides) The methods/tools you used, and the rationale for their
  use.
\item
  (2-4 slides) Results (however preliminary).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Show main visuals, analyses/tables, and/or any products built
    (interactive graphics, websites, etc.)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  (1-2 slides) Lessons learned thus far and/or plans to mitigate
  challenges.
\end{enumerate}

Students must submit both their slides \emph{and} the \texttt{.rmd} file
used to render the slides along with their video recording as a
\texttt{.zip} file to CANVAS by the end of the scheduled class time.
There will be no in-person and/or virtual class meeting this day.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Note that it is vital that all students submit their video on time
so that others will have sufficient time to provide feedback.}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{part-2-feedback}{%
\subsection{Part 2: Feedback}\label{part-2-feedback}}

Each student will be randomly assigned the names of 5 peers in their
class. The names will be circulated on \textbf{December 2}. Each student
will be required to watch the recordings of their assigned classmates
and provide substantive feedback by \textbf{Sunday December 6 11:59PM}.
All comments/Feedback should be written on a shared \textbf{Google
Document}, which will be circulated on \textbf{December 2} via the class
Slack channel. The recorded presentations will be stored in a share
folder on CANVAS. All enrolled students will have access to this folder.

\hypertarget{project-report}{%
\section{Project Report}\label{project-report}}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

December 11 & 30\% & 12 pages/3000 words (double-spaced; 12pt
font)\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The report is a complete description of the project's analysis and
results. The report should be 12 pages (3000 words) in length
(\emph{double-spaced; 12 pt font}) and cover the below bullet points. As
with the proposals, no written material will be considered beyond page
12 when reviewing the report (a work cited can span onto a 13th page, or
\textgreater{} 3000 words). Below I've outlined points that one should
aim to discuss in each section. Note that paper should read as a
cohesive report, so do not respond to these bullet points verbatim.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Introduction}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What is the aim of the project?

    \begin{itemize}

      Summarize the problem
    \item
      State your goals
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    What do you do in this report?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      offer a roadmap of the project
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Problem Statement and Background}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Give a clear and complete statement of the problem and/or aim of
    your analysis.
  \item
    Include a brief summary of any related work that has tried to tackle
    a project similar to yours (i.e.~a \emph{light} literature review)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Where does the data come from?
  \item
    What is the unit of observation?
  \item
    What are the variables of interest?
  \item
    What steps did you take to wrangle the data?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Analysis}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Describe the methods/tools you explored in your project.
  \item
    Outline in detail our entire analysis.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Justify the tools/methods that you used.
    \item
      Assume the reader is smart but doesn't know \texttt{R}/Machine
      Learning well. That is, be crystal clear about what you're doing
      and why.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Results}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Give a detailed summary of your results.
  \item
    Present your results clearly and concisely.
  \item
    Please use visualizations and tables whenever possible.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Discussion}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Speak on the ``success'' of your project (as defined in your
    proposal).

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Did you achieve what you set out to do? If not why?
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    What tools/methods did you consider but \emph{not} use in the final
    analysis?
  \item
    How would you expand the analysis if given more time?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The reports must be submitted as a hardcopy (i.e.~the \texttt{.rmd}
notebook must be rendered as a \texttt{.html}) to CANVAS by 9PM on
December 11th. \textbf{\emph{Note that given the page constraints, no
\texttt{R} code should be visible in the rendered document.}}
