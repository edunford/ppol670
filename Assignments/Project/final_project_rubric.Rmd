### Content

The student's project sufficiently addressed these general areas.

- **Introduction** (5 point)

    + What is the aim of the project? 
      - Summarize the problem
      - State your goals
      
    + What do you do in this report?
      - offer a roadmap of the project

- **Problem Statement and Background** (5 point)
    
    + Give a clear and complete statement of the problem and/or aim of your analysis. 
    
    + Include a brief summary of any related work that has tried to tackle a project similar to yours (i.e. a _light_ literature review)
    
- **Data** (5 point)

    + Where does the data come from? 
    
    + What is the unit of observation? 
    
    + What are the variables of interest?
    
    + What steps did you take to wrangle the data?

- **Analysis** (5 point)

    + Describe the methods/tools you explored in your project. 
    
    + Outline in detail our entire analysis. 
        - Justify the tools/methods that you used.
        - Assume the reader is smart but doesn't know `R`/Machine Learning well. That is, be crystal clear about what you're doing and why.

- **Results** (5 point)

    + Give a detailed summary of your results. 
    
    + Present your results clearly and concisely.
